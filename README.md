- Stakeholder identification 
- Identifying what already exists in the same field 
- Ethical concerns 

### Data Acquisition 

- Collection of data from trusted sources for the development of the model is necessary 
- Sources: Survey, camera, sensor, API, webscraping, etc. 
- System map: Find link between several aspects and conceptualize a solution to the problem by backtracing 

### Data Visualization

**Types of Modeling** 
1. Rule-based 
2. Learning-based 
   - Rule-based: The AI is defined under labeled and sorted datasets and trained by rules and gives answers to the model's questions 
   - Learning-based: The AI is given unlabeled data and then the patterns are automatically recognized and then matched with the labeled dataset, the AI identifies similarities and covers the entire part 

**Types of Learning-based Approaches:** 
- Linear Regression 
- Logistical Regression 
- Deep ANN 
- Decision Trees 

**Easy root node at the top, interior node between, leaf node end, easy**
